That's why we created Artconomy Workload Organization and Overview (AWOO).\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  AWOO begins with your\n                  <router-link\n                      :to=\"{name: 'Settings', params: {username: viewer.username, tabName: 'options'}}\"\n                      v-if=\"viewer.username\"\n                  >Maximum Load, configurable in your settings.</router-link>\n                  <span v-else>\n                    Maximum Load, configurable in your settings.\n                  </span>\n                  Your maximum load is a number of 'points' you can assign to tasks. For instance, if you have a\n                  maximum load of 10, and sell sketches with a task weight of 2, Artconomy will close commissions once\n                  you have five of them.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  AWOO is able to track multiple products' workloads. If you also sell full color pieces and set\n                  their task weight as 5, you could have one full color commission and two sketches (totalling 9 points)\n                  before commissions would close, since both a sketch and a full color would put your workload over 10\n                  at that point. You could also have two full color commissions to use up all 10 points.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  In addition to this, you may also specify the 'Max at Once' setting for a product. If you never want to\n                  do more than two sketches at a time, you would set this to 2. This will make sure that if you already\n                  have two sketches accepted, AWOO will delist sketches from your store so you don't receive more\n                  requests for them.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  AWOO manages when you are considered 'open' for commissions, sending alerts to Portrait and\n                  Landscape subscribers when you are available. Note that you may still be closed for commissions even\n                  if you have some workload to spare.
