            <p>
              To buy a commission on Artconomy, find any artist who is open.
              <span @click.capture.stop.prevent="searchOpen" class="who-is-open-link">
                <router-link
                    :to="{name: 'SearchProducts'}"
                >
              You can see a list of open artists here!
              </router-link></span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you have found a product that you like, click the Order button on the product page and
              fill out the provided form. If you're registered with us, you can even attach your own character
              references with our character profiles feature! Even if you're not, you can still upload reference
              images to your order.
            </p>
            <p>
              The artist will then review your request, ask any questions or make comments, and then will finalize
              the price if they are willing to complete the piece or reject the order if they are not.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the artist has approved your request, you will be able to pay for the order. If the product is
              protected by
              <router-link

                Artconomy Shield
              </router-link>
              we will hold onto
              the money until the artist completes the work. Otherwise, the artist will arrange with you how to pay
              them.
              They may upload revisions for your approval. Please provide comments to the artist when revisions are
              uploaded to ensure the result is what you are hoping for.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the artist has completed the work, two things may happen:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>If using
                <router-link

                >
                  Artconomy Shield
                </router-link>
                ,
                you may approve the final piece or dispute it. If you do neither, it will be auto-approved in a few
                days.
              </li>
              <li>Otherwise, the order will then be finalized.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Then you can rate your artist, and if you have an account, you can add it to your collection.

              After you have created a product, it will be listed on your profile page and on the recently created
              products list on the front page. Buyers may then commission you by clicking on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you have an order, review the commissioner's request and make sure you understand it fully.
              If you are satisfied you understand the commissioner's requirements and wish to take on the work,
              <strong>add any price adjustments necessary</strong>, such as those for shipping the original if you
              include that with your product, or <strong>any extra work that their request requires, like
              wings or backgrounds.</strong>
              Finally, hit the 'Accept' button under the Payment tab.
            </p>
            <p>
              The commissioner will then review the offer and pay for it if they find it acceptable. If you are not
              using

              , you will need to arrange payment with the customer manually.
              You should then begin the work as soon as you are able, uploading any revisions along the way. When
              you are finished, submit your final piece.
            </p>
            <p>
              The commissioner will then review and approve your work. Once approved, you will receive the money
              that has been held for you. You will then be able to rate your customer and provide comments.</p>

              Products protected by Artconomy shield are guaranteed to be completed by the artist, and to be paid
              for by the commissioner. If there's an issue with a piece being commissioned, the commissioner may

              When you purchase a product with Artconomy shield, we hold onto your payment until the artist
              completes the work. <em><strong>If the artist does not complete the work, you receive your money back,

              When, as an artist, you list a product with Artconomy shield, you know the commissioner has already
              paid with their credit card and that they've agreed to our dispute resolution service.

              commission is completed.</strong></em>

            <p>
              Artists and commissioners who use Artconomy Shield help build trust in the artistic community.

              is finished, or an extended period between the task's acceptance and its
              completion has elapsed, a commissioner will have the option to file a dispute. Disputes will come up
              for review by our staff.
            </p>
            <p>
              Disputes are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Our staff will review the order's history, and ask any
              additional questions, or give opportunities for action as needed before making any decisions.

            <p>One or more of the following conditions will make an order eligible for a refund:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The artist has taken an extraordinary amount of time beyond estimate to complete the work (this
                will not be considered if the final is already delivered by the time the dispute is filed)
              </li>
              <li>The artist has drawn something <strong>severely</strong> under their standard quality of work as
                depicted in their gallery.
              </li>
              <li>The artist has drawn something completely different than what a reasonable reader would have
                expected the commission notes to require.
              </li>
              <li>Sales involving original goods being shipped do not arrive or are damaged. Recipient must provide
                proof of damage. Artists are expected to use trackable forms of shipment and buy insurance to cover
                damage so that they may claim the difference from their carrier.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following conditions will <strong>NOT</strong> make an order eligible for a refund:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The artist is moderately over estimate.</li>
              <li>The final piece has flaws which were in previously posted revisions that were either commented on
                by the commissioner or which the commissioner had time for comment and no comment was made.
              </li>
              <li>The piece is within reasonable variance of the artist's history of quality, but it is not quite
                what the commissioner hoped for.
              </li>
              <li>The final piece has minor differences from the description, or differences that could result from
                reasonable mistakes when reading the commission notes.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The above cases, while regrettable, will not be warranted against by Artconomy for the cost of the
              commission price. The commissioner is free to include any information about their commissioning
              experience when rating the artist.

            <p>Artconomy has three plans to choose from, depending on where you are in your professional journey.</p>
            <h3>The Free Plan</h3>
            <p>
              The free plan is for people who take commissions on the side or only rarely take them. It allows you to
              track up to one order for free. It handles all of the references, the description, communication with your
              commissioner, and provides a place for you to upload revisions/WIPs for comment on that order.
            </p>
            <p>
              The free plan is a great way to test if Artconomy is truly <strong>right for you and your
              workflow.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>For extra protection on an order, you can enable
              <router-link
                  :to="{name: 'BuyAndSell', params: {question: 'shield'}}"
              >Artconomy Shield,
              </router-link>
              our escrow service, or you can use your payment processor of choice to handle the payment.
            </p>
            <h3>The Basic Plan</h3>
            <p>The basic plan is best for artists who don't have a high volume of orders, but are expecting to handle
              more than one commission a month.</p>
            <p>The basic plan allows you to track as many orders as you like on Artconomy.
              If you use shield on your orders, the only cost will be the shield fee.
              The basic plan comes with a slight discount on the shield fee.</p>
            <p>If you want to track an order without using shield
              (such as for when shield isn't available in your country, or your customer prefers PayPal or
              another processor), you'll be assessed a small fee. At the end of your monthly billing cycle, your card
              will be charged for however many orders were tracked without shield.</p>
            <h3>Artconomy Landscape</h3>
            <p>Artconomy Landscape is our premium offering. In exchange for a monthly fee, you get a sharp discount on
              Artconomy Shield, and you can track as many non-shield orders as you like for free!</p>

              plan, your prices will change, too.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, if you turn on 'absorb fees', you will have control over the final price, but if you
              change plans, it will change how much of that price goes to fees.</p>
            <p>The price calculator is available on every order and every product-- it will show you the full
              consequences of any price change on fees. It also includes a handy calculator that lets you estimate your
              hourly rate so you can determine if your price is high enough to compensate for your time.</p>
            <h3>A word on our pricing</h3>
            <p>Artconomy Shield is an escrow service. Escrow services are uncommon online, and Stripe, our payment
              processor, is capable of handling it, but isn't optimized for it.
              <a href="https://artconomy.com/blog/posts/2022/11/16/escrow-for-art-commissions/" target="_blank"
                 rel="noopener">We are firm believers in escrow</a>,
              which is why we offer it. However, it does result in Stripe's fees being higher for us-- including a $2
              fee for every connected account we pay out to <strong>each month</strong> on top of the credit card
              fees.</p>
            <p>As a result, shield fees must always incorporate this cost. However, with Landscape, this $2
              (and other upstream fees) are chiefly covered every month by the subscription fee, so shield costs are
              able to be reduced significantly. This is also why tips are only available to Landscape users.</p>
            <p>For non-shield orders, there are still costs with hosting and maintaining the service. We offer our
              free tier for small time artists trying to get started. On our basic plan, however, we do charge a fee
              to offset costs on each non-shield order. We believe the order handling is the best out there for art
              commissions, and that the time saved will always be worth more than the fee. The net for non-shield
              orders on our basic plan is calculated to be $1 after Stripe's processing fees.</p>
            <p>Our goal, then, is to try to make at least a dollar on each order, and always provide value worth
              the cost. With this 'at least $1 an order' target (preferably a bit more), we can easily project and
              guess how many orders we need to process to cover our costs and pay our team members.</p>
            <p>Why lay all this out, you may ask? Because Artconomy's goal is to help artists run their business,
              and that means helping them reason about pricing. The best way to do this is to lead by example,
              showing you how we structure things. If you'd like to be engaged deeply, in real time, with our decision
              making process, we encourage you to <a href="https://discord.gg/4nWK9mf">join our Discord server</a>,

        <strong>What is the Artconomy Virtual Table?</strong>
      </v-expansion-panel-title>

              The Artconomy Virtual Table is an in-person/online hybrid experience run by Artconomy staffers at
              conventions. During a virtual table event, selected artists are on standby to take commission orders
              (often, con badges), which are printed on a printer and handed over during the convention. This way, you
              get the benefit of taking orders at a convention without having to leave home!
            </p>
            <v-img :src="conBadge" :contain="true" max-height="40vh"></v-img>
            <p>The Virtual Table is also an opportunity to sell your merch for events that you cannot physically attend.
              If you can get the merchandise to us ahead of the event and we have room, we'll sell it for you.</p>
            <p>The virtual table event is also quite social-- you'll be in a private Discord channel with other selected
              artists. Our artists typically stream together as they complete orders. If the pieces are safe for work
              (or the convention allows adult content) we'll stream the live drawing on a TV set right at our table!</p>
            <p><strong>Virtual Table positions are limited--</strong> both based on how many events we have a booth at
              per year, and how many artists we can accommodate at a time during the event. Priority always goes to
              <router-link :to="{name: 'BuyAndSell', params: {question: 'landscape'}}">Landscape subscribers.
              </router-link>
              Service fee pricing depends on the event.
            </p>
            <p>If you're interested in joining a virtual table event,

              Many countries are supported and their banks can be
              linked to use
              <router-link

              </router-link>
              When new countries are available from our processor, this list will be updated. However,
              Artconomy Shield is not required to list products and take orders on Artconomy. If your country is not yet
              supported, you can still take orders without Shield protection.
            </p>
            <p>The following countries are currently supported for shield protection:</p>
            <ac-load-section :controller="stripeCountries">
              <ul>
                <li v-for="country in stripeCountries.x!.countries" :key="country.value">{{ country.text }}</li>
              </ul>
            </ac-load-section>
            <p>
              <strong>NOTE:</strong> This list is authoritative for shield. While Stripe's site says they do not support
              some of the above countries, that's only half-true: They support many more countries for payout than they
              do for fully featured platform accounts.
              <strong>The site's onboarding will guide you through the creation of an 'Express' payout account with
                Stripe-- you do not need to sign up directly on their website.</strong>

        <strong>How does Artconomy help me manage my workload?</strong>

          <v-card-text>
            <p>
              Artconomy understand the problems artists have with managing their workload and communicating with
              commissioners. That's why we created Artconomy's workload management system, nicknamed
              <strong>"AWOO" (Artconomy Workflow Organization and Overview).</strong>
            </p>
            <h3>Getting an Overview</h3>
            <p>AWOO's features start basic-- the
              <router-link v-if="isRegistered" :to="{name: 'Sales', params: {username: viewerName}}">Sales</router-link>
              <span v-else>'Sales'</span>
              button in your sidebar will take you to the Workload panel, which shows all of your orders.
              Any with new activity are highlighted, and you can message all of your commissioners at any time with the
              'Broadcast to Buyers' button. That will add a comment on all of your orders for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>All orders offer a direct communication line with your commissioner.</strong>
              Commenting on an order sends an email alert and notification to the commissioner for them to review.
              This ensures that you do not have to keep individual track of customers' email addresses to get a
              hold of them, and you never have to write a journal entry with the subject 'if I owe you art, message me.'
              Feel free to comment and ask questions to make sure you can give your customers the best
              experience possible!
            </p>
            <p>You can also use the green
              <router-link :to="{name: 'BuyAndSell', params: {question: 'outside-orders'}}">'New Invoice'</router-link>
              button to track sales made off-site.
            </p>
            <h3>Smart Availability</h3>
            <p>AWOO is also able to intelligently manage your availability.
              It begins with your
              <router-link
                  :to="{name: 'BuyAndSell', params: {questions: 'options'}}"
                  v-if="isRegistered"
              >Slots, configurable in your settings.
              </router-link>
              <span v-else>
                      Slots, configurable in your settings.
                    </span>
              Your slots are the number of open spaces you have for commissions. Most commissions should take up one
              slot,
              but if you offer a product that takes more time, you can change the number of slots it takes up.
              For instance, if you have 10 slots, and sell inked pieces that take up 2 slots each, Artconomy will close
              commissions once you have five of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              AWOO is able to track multiple products' slots. If you set your slots to 10, and sell full color pieces
              that take up five slots, you could have one full color commission and two inked pieces (totalling 9
              points)
              leaving you with one point remaining. If you don't have any products that take up only one point,
              AWOO will close commissions for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to this, you may also specify the 'Max at Once' setting for a product. If you never want
              to do more than two sketches at a time, you would set this to 2 for your sketch product.
              This will make sure that if you already have two sketches accepted, AWOO will delist sketches from your
              store so you don't receive more requests for them.
            </p>
            <p>
              AWOO manages when you are considered 'open' for commissions, sending real-time alerts to watchers when
              you are available. Note that you may still be closed for commissions even if you have some workload to
              spare. See
              <router-link
                  :to="{name: 'BuyAndSell', params: {question: 'why-commissions-disabled'}}"
              >
                'Why are my Commissions Disabled?'
              </router-link>
              for more information as to why this may happen.
            </p>
            <p>You can effectively disable AWOO's slot management by setting your Slot count to a number
              so high you'll never reach it. You can then open and close yourself with the
              <router-link
                  :to="{name: 'Settings', params: {username: viewer!.username, tabName: 'options'}}"
                  v-if="isRegistered"
              >Commissions Closed setting.
              </router-link>
              <span v-else>
                      Commissions Closed setting, available on your settings page.
                    </span>
              <strong>This is not recommended unless you are experienced in managing
                your workload.</strong> Appearing to be open when you are not leads to customer service issues,
              which can affect your rating and reputation.
              Alternatively, you can use the
              <router-link :to="{name: 'BuyAndSell', params: {question: 'waitlists'}}">Waitlist feature.</router-link>

              If you're out and about at a convention, working on a special project, or you're taking orders on the fly
              from customers in your stream, you might want to create an order for tracking yourself,
              instead of having a customer do it.

                AWOO

              can help you keep track of these orders. You can create a new invoice from your
              <router-link :to="{name: 'Sales', params: {username: viewer!.username}}"
                           v-if="isRegistered && viewer!.artist_mode"

              get started!
            </p>
            <p>Invoices can do several neat things. For instance:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You can specify an email or Artconomy user name to send the invoice to in order to collect payment.
              </li>
              <li>You can use your existing product listings as a template for pricing and workload management.</li>
              <li>You can prevent AWOO from tracking any impact on your workload if the piece is already finished, and
                you just need to collect payment or send the finished piece.
              </li>
              <li>You can handle tasks that have already been paid, but which impact your workload, so
                AWOO can keep track of them.
              </li>
              <li>You can issue a completely custom order not related to any product you currently have listed.</li>
              <li>You can create an order that doesn't have the customer's information-- useful if you want to track the
                impact of an outside project or commission but don't need to send updates to anyone.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Invoices can always be issued, regardless of whether or not your commissions are closed, or a product is
              normally unavailable. <strong>Please be cautious when taking orders this way if you already have a full
              workload--</strong>
              failing to deliver pieces in a timely manner can affect your reputation, and it is better to keep promises
              you have already made than to make new ones.

              Waitlists allow you to take orders that you aren't committing to complete. There are a few times when you
              might use waitlisting:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>You want to gauge interest in a commission type by letting people pre-order it.</li>
              <li>You're fully booked, but you want to keep track of interest for clients who are waiting.</li>
              <li>You have a <a

            <p>Wailists are currently only available to Landscape subscribers. Waitlisted orders have no commitment on
              the part of the artist-- they don't have to be taken in any particular order and they don't have to be
              completed at all. You can also clear your waitlist at any time.</p>
            <p>You can either enable waitlist on a particular product, or you can waitlist orders as they come in.
              If a new order arrives and you wish to waitlist it, click the waitlist button at the top of the order.</p>

              Artconomy can generate
              <router-link :to="{name: 'BuyAndSell', params: {question: 'Landscape'}}">invoices on PayPal for you,
              </router-link>
              and add orders to your queue once those invoices are paid.
              However, you might want to consider using
              <router-link :to="{name: 'BuyAndSell', params: {question: 'shield'}}">Artconomy Shield</router-link>
              instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              PayPal has several key limitations:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>PayPal has separate policies for business and personal use that can be confusing.</li>
              <li>PayPal's dispute resolution is limited and not well suited for art, especially when using their
                personal service.
              </li>
              <li>PayPal has been known to suspend accounts with little recourse or comment.</li>
              <li>PayPal has a mixed reputation when dealing with adult content. Their written policy, taken literally,
                bans all adult content, though many still use it for the purpose.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For these reasons, we recommend using
              <router-link :to="{name: 'BuyAndSell', params: {question: 'shield'}}">Artconomy Shield</router-link>
              to protect your orders.
            </p>
            <p>However, if you need to use PayPal, such as if Shield is not supported in your country or you need
              invoicing features Artconomy does not yet support, you can integrate Artconomy and PayPal together.
              Setup for PayPal integration is in your
              <router-link :to="{name: 'MyView', params: {viewName: 'Premium'}}">Premium Settings.</router-link>

          <strong>How does Artconomy compare to Patreon?</strong>
        </v-expansion-panel-title>
        <v-card>
          <v-card-text>
            <p>
              Patreon is a popular platform for artists that allows them to receive monthly
              contributions from patrons. Patrons are also able to receive exclusive rewards for being monthly
              donors.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that services like Patreon and Artconomy are best used together to help artists achieve their
              goals of
              self-sufficiency from their artistic work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Patreon has a significant limitation however--
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem" target="_blank">the free rider problem.</a>
              The more patrons one has, the more likely it is that one will distribute the rewards to people who are
              not contributing.
              This disincentivizes people from signing up for an artist's Patreon, as they can get the art for free.
            </p>
            <p>
              While solutions exist to deter this behavior-- such as sending takedown notices to hosting sites and
              threatening legal action, these often create customer relations issues and cost more time and effort
              than can be recovered, and can never be fully effective, as people may always share files privately.
              Additionally, offering physical goods and other creative uncopyable rewards is an option, but may not
              always be practical.
            </p>
            <p>
              Artconomy does not have this problem, as each commission is tied to a specific seller who pays
              individually for their pieces. Thankfully one does not need to exclusively use Patreon or Artconomy.
            </p>
            <p>Artconomy may add functionality like Patreon has in the future, but for now remains focused on building
              the
              best freelance art business toolkit.</p>

          <v-card-text>
            <p>
              Featured products are products hand-curated by Artconomy staff.
              Several criteria are used to determine whether a product is featured,
              <em>some of which are subjective and up to staff judgement.</em>
              These include (but are not limited to):
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Quality of the work Offered</li>
              <li>Ratings and feedback from commissioners who have worked with the artist</li>
              <li>Value for price</li>
              <li>Shield Capability (Not required, but it helps!)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Featured products may change and are rotated on the front page at random. If you believe there is a
              product that should be considered for featured status,

        <strong>Is Artconomy Secure?</strong>
      </v-expansion-panel-title>
      <v-expansion-panel-text>
        <v-card>
          <v-card-text>
            <p>
              No system is completely secure, and anyone who advises you otherwise should be regarded with
              suspicion, or at least considered ignorant.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, Artconomy takes security seriously. We do not allow unencrypted connections to our site.
              Payments are processed through Stripe, with card data sent directly to their servers rather than ours.
              If someone were to hack in to our servers, they would not be able to retrieve your card number.
            </p>
            <p>
              Passwords are not stored in plain text, but are hashed to prevent release of your raw password.
              They are also salted to reduce the probability of hackers finding a password that works with the
              resulting hash and using it to log into other services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Artconomy also uses strict frameworks for accessing and manipulating its databases to reduce the
              probability of SQL injections and makes use of anti-clickjacking technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              For especially sensitive data that must be stored on our servers, we use
              encryption with offline, cold stored, secured keys, which are used only as long as explicit operations
              by our executive technical staff require.
              <strong>Note: At the time of writing, no data of this nature is actually stored on Artconomy, but if we
                end up having to store some, we will do so in this manner.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              These are only some of the things we do to keep your data safe, and we continue to keep security in
              mind when developing our products. You are always advised to use
              <router-link
                  v-if="isRegistered"
                  :to="{name: 'Settings', params: {username: viewer!.username, tabName: 'credentials', subTabName: 'two-factor'}}">

                    </span>
              for extra security, Especially if you are an artist!
            </p>
            <p>Do not share your account password with anyone. Artconomy staff will <em><strong>never</strong></em>
              ask for your password.</p>

              After you have completed your tasks, the money you've earned will be released to your Artconomy
              account holdings. It will automatically be sent to your bank account, unless you have opted out of

      <v-expansion-panel-text>
        <v-card>
          <v-card-text>
            <p>
              Artconomy does not presently support the sale of physical goods <strong>aside from original
              pieces made during the commissioning process--</strong> it does not have an inventory system. When
              shipping physically commissioned goods while using Artconomy Shield, you must buy insurance to cover
              the price of any shipment you make, including the commission price, and you must incorporate the
              shipping price into the final sale price.
            </p>
            <p>We recommend asking the customer for their address before accepting the order so you can
              precalculate these shipping costs.</p>

              Artconomy is set up for custom art commissions, and those custom art commissions are usually digital in
              nature. However it is not built for goods like premade digital download packs. Such functionality may be
              available in the future.
