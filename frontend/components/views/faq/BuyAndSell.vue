            To buy a commission on Artconomy, find any artist who is open.
            <span @click.capture.stop.prevent="searchOpen" class="who-is-open-link">
              <router-link
              :to="{name: 'SearchProducts'}"
            >
            You can see a list of open artists here!
            </router-link></span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have found a product that you like, click the Order button on the product page and
            fill out the provided form. If you're registered with us, you can even attach your own character
            references with our character profiles feature!
          </p>
          <p>
            The artist will then review your request, ask any questions or make comments, and then will finalize
            the price if they are willing to complete the piece or reject the order if they are not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the artist has approved your request, you will be able to pay for the order. If the product is
            protected by
            <router-link
                :to="{name: 'BuyAndSell', params: {question: 'shield'}}"
            >
              Artconomy Shield</router-link>
            we will hold onto
            the money until the artist completes the work. Otherwise, the artist will arrange with you how to pay
            them.
            They may upload revisions for your approval. Please provide comments to the artist when revisions are
            uploaded to ensure the result is what you are hoping for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the artist has completed the work, two things may happen:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If using
              <router-link
                  :to="{name: 'BuyAndSell', params: {question: 'shield'}}"
              >
                Artconomy Shield</router-link>,
              you may approve the final piece, and the artist will be paid.
            </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the order will then be finalized.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Then you can rate your artist, and if you have an account, you can add it to your collection.

          <p>
            Once you have an order, review the commissioner's request and make sure you understand it fully.
            If you are satisfied you understand the commissioner's requirements and wish to take on the work,
            <strong>add any price adjustments necessary</strong>, such as those for shipping the original if you
            include that with your product, or <strong>any extra work that their request requires, like
            wings or backgrounds.</strong>

            You should then begin the work as soon as you are able, uploading any revisions along the way. When
            you are finished, submit your final piece.
          </p>
          <p>
            The commissioner will then review and approve your work. Once approved, you will receive the money
            that has been held for you. You will then be able to rate your customer and provide comments.</p>

            Products protected by Artconomy shield are guaranteed to be completed by the artist, and to be paid
            for by the commissioner. If there's an issue with a piece being commissioned, the commissioner may

            When you purchase a product with Artconomy shield, we hold onto your payment until the artist
            completes the work. <em><strong>If the artist does not complete the work, you receive your money back,

            Artists and commissioners who use Artconomy Shield help build trust in the artistic community.
            Artists who are unable to use Artconomy Shield (such as those without US Bank Accounts) can still
            list products and take orders on Artconomy, but must arrange payment with commissioners manually.

          <p>Artists using Shield will be assessed a one-time setup fee, required by our payment processor, of

            is finished, or an extended period between the task's acceptance and its
            completion has elapsed, a commissioner will have the option to file a dispute. Disputes will come up
            for review by our staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Disputes are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Our staff will review the order's history, and ask any

          <ul>
            <li>The artist has taken an extraordinary amount of time beyond estimate to complete the work (this
              will not be considered if the final is already delivered by the time the dispute is filed)
            </li>
            <li>The artist has drawn something <strong>severely</strong> under their standard quality of work as
              depicted in their gallery.
            </li>
            <li>The artist has drawn something completely different than what a reasonable reader would have
              expected the commission notes to require.
            </li>
            <li>Sales involving original goods being shipped do not arrive or are damaged. Recipient must provide
              proof of damage. Artists are expected to use trackable forms of shipment and buy insurance to cover
              damage so that they may claim the difference from their carrier.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The following conditions will <strong>NOT</strong> make an order eligible for a refund:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The artist is moderately over estimate.</li>
            <li>The final piece has flaws which were in previously posted revisions that were either commented on
              by the commissioner or which the commissioner had time for comment and no comment was made.
            </li>
            <li>The piece is within reasonable variance of the artist's history of quality, but it is not quite
              what the commissioner hoped for.
            </li>
            <li>The final piece has minor differences from the description, or differences that could result from
              reasonable mistakes when reading the commission notes.
            </li>
          </ul>

            The above cases, while regrettable, will not be warranted against by Artconomy for the cost of the
            commission price. The commissioner is free to include any information about their commissioning
            experience when rating the artist.

      <v-card>
        <v-card-text>
          <p>
            Artconomy understand the problems artists have with managing their workload and communicating with
            commissioners. That's why we created Artconomy Workload Organization and Overview (AWOO).
          </p>
          <p>
            AWOO begins with your
            <router-link
                :to="{name: 'BuyAndSell', params: {questions: 'options'}}"
                v-if="isRegistered"
            >Slots, configurable in your settings.
            </router-link>
            <span v-else>
                    Slots, configurable in your settings.
                  </span>
            Your slots are the number of open spaces you have for commissions. Most commissions should take up one slot,
            but if you offer a product that takes more time, you can change the number of slots it takes up.
            For instance, if you have 10 slots, and sell inked pieces that take up 2 slots each, Artconomy will close
            commissions once you have five of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            AWOO is able to track multiple products' slots. If you set your slots to 10, and sell full color pieces
            that take up five slots, you could have one full color commission and two inked pieces (totalling 9 points)
            leaving you with one point remaining. If you don't have any products that take up only one point,
            AWOO will close commissions for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to this, you may also specify the 'Max at Once' setting for a product. If you never want
            to do more than two sketches at a time, you would set this to 2 for your sketch product.
            This will make sure that if you already have two sketches accepted, AWOO will delist sketches from your
            store so you don't receive more requests for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            AWOO manages when you are considered 'open' for commissions, sending real-time alerts to Portrait and
            Landscape subscribers when you are available. Note that you may still be closed for commissions even
            if you have some workload to spare. See
            <router-link
                :to="{name: 'BuyAndSell', params: {question: 'why-commissions-disabled'}}"
            >
              'Why are my Commissions Disabled?'
            </router-link>
            for more information as to why this may happen.
          </p>
          <p>You can effectively disable AWOO's slot management by setting your Slot count to a number
            so high you'll never reach it. You can then open and close yourself with the
            <router-link
                :to="{name: 'Settings', params: {username: viewer.username, tabName: 'options'}}"

                    Commissions Closed setting, available on your settings page.
                  </span>
            <strong>This is not recommended unless you are experienced in managing
              your workload.</strong> Appearing to be open when you are not leads to customer service issues,
            which can affect your rating and reputation. If you feel that you need more slots than the maximum setting,
            <a href="#" @click.prevent="setSupport(true)">please contact support</a>.
          </p>

            <strong>All orders offer a direct communication line with your commissioner.</strong>
            Commenting on an order sends an email alert and notification to the commissioner for them to review.
            This ensures that you do not have to keep individual track of customers' email addresses to get a
            hold of them, and you never have to write a journal entry with the subject 'if I owe you art, message me.'
            Feel free to comment and ask questions to make sure you can give your customers the best
            experience possible!

            If you're out and about at a convention, working on a special project, or you're taking orders on the fly
            from customers in your stream, you might want to create an order for tracking yourself,
            instead of having a customer do it.
            <router-link
                :to="{name: 'BuyAndSell', params: {question: 'awoo-workload-management'}}">
              AWOO
            </router-link>
            can help you keep track of these orders. You can create a new invoice from your
            <router-link :to="{name: 'Sales', params: {username: viewer.username}}"
                         v-if="isRegistered && viewer.artist_mode"
            >sales page</router-link><span v-else>sales page</span>. Just click the green button in the lower right to
            get started!
          </p>
          <p>Invoices can do several neat things. For instance:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can specify an email or Artconomy user name to send the invoice to in order to collect payment.</li>
            <li>You can use your existing product listings as a template for pricing and workload management.</li>
            <li>You can prevent AWOO from tracking any impact on your workload if the piece is already finished, and
              you just need to collect payment or send the finished piece.</li>
            <li>You can handle tasks that have already been paid, but which impact your workload, so
              AWOO can keep track of them.</li>
            <li>You can issue a completely custom order not related to any product you currently have listed.</li>
            <li>You can create an order that doesn't have the customer's information-- useful if you want to track the
              impact of an outside project or commission but don't need to send updates to anyone.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Invoices can always be issued, regardless of whether or not your commissions are closed, or a product is
            normally unavailable. <strong>Please be cautious when taking orders this way if you already have a full workload--</strong>
            failing to deliver pieces in a timely manner can affect your reputation, and it is better to keep promises
            you have already made than to make new ones.

            uses a smart algorithm to help determine if you should be considered open for commissions.
            On your sales page, you will see information about your current commission status and any reasons
            why you may not be open. Some of these reasons may include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You have marked yourself as 'commissions closed' in your settings.</li>
            <li>You have used up all of your slots, also configurable in your settings.</li>
            <li>You still have some slots, but none of your products will fit in the remaining workload.
            </li>
            <li>You still have some slots, but any products which DO fit in the remaining ones have
              already reached their 'max at once' limit.
            </li>
            <li>
              You still have some slots, do not have commissions closed, and have viable products,
              but you still have open requests left over from the last time you were open for commissions. You
              must accept or reject these before you will be able to take new orders, in order to reduce the
              incidence of customer service issues.

            PayPal is a popular service used by Artists to take payments from commissioners,
            however, it has several key limitations:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>PayPal has separate policies for business and personal use that can be confusing.</li>
            <li>PayPal's dispute resolution is limited and not well suited for art, especially when using their
              personal service.
            </li>
            <li>PayPal has been known to suspend accounts with little recourse or comment.</li>
            <li>PayPal has a mixed reputation when dealing with adult content. Their written policy, taken literally,
              bans all adult content, though many still use it for the purpose.

            is built with the needs of commissioners and artists in mind, and specializes in the needs of both.
            PayPal's limitations also prevent it from being a backend for Artconomy to take payments, so we are
            unable to accept payments via PayPal.

      <div slot="header"><strong>How does Artconomy compare to Patreon?</strong></div>
      <v-card>
        <v-card-text>
          <p>
            Patreon is a popular platform for artists that allows them to receive monthly
            contributions from patrons. Patrons are also able to receive exclusive rewards for being monthly
            donors.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that services like Patreon and Artconomy are best used together to help artists achieve their goals of
            self-sufficiency from their artistic work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patreon has a significant limitation however--
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem" target="_blank">the free rider problem.</a>
            The more patrons one has, the more likely it is that one will distribute the rewards to people who are
            not contributing.
            This disincentivizes people from signing up for an artist's Patreon, as they can get the art for free.
          </p>
          <p>
            While solutions exist to deter this behavior-- such as sending takedown notices to hosting sites and
            threatening legal action, these often create customer relations issues and cost more time and effort
            than can be recovered, and can never be fully effective, as people may always share files privately.
            Additionally, offering physical goods and other creative uncopyable rewards is an option, but may not
            always be practical.
          </p>
          <p>
            Artconomy does not have this problem, as each commission is tied to a specific seller who pays
            individually for their pieces. Thankfully one does not need to exclusively use Patreon or Artconomy.
          </p>
          <p>Artconomy may add functionality like Patreon has in the future, but for now remains focused on building the
            best freelance art business toolkit.</p>

          <p>
            Featured products are products hand-curated by Artconomy staff.
            Several criteria are used to determine whether a product is featured,
            <em>some of which are subjective and up to staff judgement.</em>
            These include (but are not limited to):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Quality of the work Offered</li>
            <li>Ratings and feedback from commissioners who have worked with the artist</li>
            <li>Value for price</li>
            <li>Shield Capability (Not required, but it helps!)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Featured products may change and are rotated on the front page at random. If you believe there is a
            product that should be considered for featured status,

      <div slot="header"><strong>Is Artconomy Secure?</strong></div>
      <v-card>
        <v-card-text>
          <p>
            No system is completely secure, and anyone who advises you otherwise should be regarded with
            suspicion, or at least considered ignorant.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Artconomy takes security seriously. We do not allow unencrypted connections to our site.
            Payment information is handled only long enough to process it and to store it offsite in secure data
            stores so that even if we are hacked, hackers will have limited ability to steal your information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Passwords are not stored in plain text, but are hashed to prevent release of your raw password.
            They are also salted to reduce the probability of hackers finding a password that works with the
            resulting hash and using it to log into other services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Artconomy also uses strict frameworks for accessing and manipulating its databases to reduce the
            probability of SQL injections and makes use of anti-clickjacking technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            For especially sensitive data that must be stored on our servers (such as tax ID information), we use
            encryption with offline, cold stored, secured keys, which are used only as long as explicit operations
            by our executive technical staff require.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are only some of the things we do to keep your data safe, and we continue to keep security in
            mind when developing our products. You are always advised to use
            <router-link
                v-if="isRegistered"

            for extra security, Especially if you are an artist!
          </p>
          <p>Do not share your account password with anyone. Artconomy staff will <em><strong>never</strong></em>
            ask for your password.</p>
