        </p>
        <p>
          This is an agreement ("Agreement") between the commissioner (“Commissioner”), artist (“Artist”), and the
          intermediary (“Artconomy”) to complete an artistic work ("Commission").
        </p>
        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <p>
          Artconomy's escrow and dispute resolution service will be known as "Artconomy Shield".
        </p>
        <p>
          The Artist will, to their abilities and earnest interpretation, render a work or works as specified in the
          product descriptions and the Commissioner's notes (the “Deliverables”). The Artist is expected to have read
          and fully understood, to the best of their ability, the requirements of the Commissioner before accepting the
          commission.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Commissioner will pay, up front, the amount agreed upon in the order form. If the product is marked as
          covered by the Artconomy Shield escrow service, this amount (the “Escrow Amount”) will be held in escrow by
          Artconomy until the work is completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Arconomy Shield is used, Artconomy will release to the Artist the Escrow Amount, less its fees as scheduled
          with the Artist (the “Fees”), either (a) within 10 business days after the Commissioner approves the
          Deliverables; or (b) in the event neither an affirmative approval is given nor a dispute is filed within a
          period of ten days after the Deliverables are posted (the “Review Period”), within 10 business days after the
          expiration of the Review Period.
        </p>
        <h2>Revisions</h2>
        <p>
          The Artist may offer opportunities for note and revision (“Revisions”), but if and only if the order provides
          for Revisions and, in that case, only so many Revisions as the order specifies. The Revisions shall be scoped
          to reasonable changes at the point of the Deliverable's progress, such as altering linework on an uncolored
          revision, or changing flat colors if the medium permits. If the commissioner does not give notes for revision
          after five days of the revision's posting, the Commissioner waives the right to offer revision notes and the
          Artist may continue as though approval were explicitly given.
        </p>
        <h2>Disputes</h2>
        <p>For works covered by Artconomy Shield, a dispute may be filed by the commissioner:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At a time equal to 1.25x times the estimated turnaround time, (in business days), rounded up to the next
            day, after the order is placed
          </li>
          <li>After the final Deliverable is delivered to the commissioner</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Examples of reasons for filing a dispute include but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Artist has taken longer than is reasonable to complete Deliverables</li>
          <li>The Deliverables deviate from the product's description and the Commissioner provided reasonably
            understandable details for the order.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Commissioner and Artist agree that Artconomy’s determination in any dispute is binding and final. The
          Artist and the Commissioner further agree not to seek any damages from each other related to the Deliverables.
          Deliverables are to be considered 'as-is', and not to be warranted for any specific purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          In orders not covered by Artconomy Shield (including orders for which the price is $0.00), the Artist and
          Commissioner will assume all risks involved in their transactions between one another.
        </p>
        <h2>Intellectual Property and Liability</h2>
        <p>
          The commissioner hereby certifies that they hold or have otherwise obtained any required permissions or
          licensing to use any trademark, copyrighted work or other form of intellectual property requested for the
          Deliverable, and that the work being commissioned is otherwise legal to purchase within the legal framework to
          which they are subjected. The commissioner assumes liability for these licenses and indemnifies Artconomy and
          the artist from any and all losses related to errors or misrepresentation in this licensing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The artist hereby certifies that the tools that they possess have been obtained by legal means and that any
          licenses required for their use have been properly purchased and kept up to date. The artist further certifies
          that any stock images or data which are used to create the Deliverables has been properly licensed and is
          legal to use within the legal framework to which they are subjected. The artist further indemnifies Artconomy
          and the Commissioner from any and all losses related to errors or misrepresentation in this licensing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If no other terms are specified in the Artist's commission info, or in the order description from the
          commissioner (with the description taking precedence), the intellectual property rights of the Deliverables
          will be assigned to the commissioner, and the commissioner hereby grants a universal, worldwide, non-revocable
          license to the artist to transmit, store, transcode, display, and resell the resulting work and any
          derivatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the commissioner has specified via the standard order form that the commission is a private commission, the
          artist will NOT be granted any license to use the resulting work unless explicitly authorized by the
          commissioner, other than what is required to Deliver it to the commissioner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The commissioner and artist grant any applicable worldwide, universal, non-revocable license required for
          Artconomy to store, transmit, and transcode the resulting work in order to fulfill its functions as an
          intermediary and provide portfolio services to the commissioner and artist. Artconomy may not sell or use in
          advertising the resulting Deliverables without explicit written permission from applicable rightsholders
          unless it has been uploaded to their public gallery, in which case it may be used within screenshots of the
          service or when posting examples of what work has been commissioned through Artconomy.
        </p>
        <h2>Arbitration</h2>
        <p>
          Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach thereof, shall be settled
          by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules.
          The number of arbitrators shall be one. The place of arbitration shall be Houston, Texas. Texas law shall
          apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
          thereof. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the claim, dispute or other
          matter in question has arisen, and in no event shall it be made after two years from when the aggrieved party
          knew or should have known of the controversy, claim, dispute or breach.
        </p>
        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Texas, United States, without
          regard to its conflict of law provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Artconomy's failure to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of
          those rights. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
          remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
          between parties regarding this Commission, and supersedes and replaces any prior agreements that might have
          between the parties regarding this Commission.
        </p>
        <p>
          All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination,
          including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of
          liability.
