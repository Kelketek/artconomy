        <h3>Scope, Intent, and Responsibilities</h3>

        <p>
          Artconomy's purpose is to provide a marketplace and set of tools to improve the business viability of artists
          creating custom commission work. As a marketplace, it intends also to connect commissioners with artists.
          In order to provide this service, users are expected to observe the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Users offering products for sale of art created by another entity must include that entity's trade name
            in the relevant product descriptions. This includes human artists, artist collectives, and AI programs which
            contribute substantially to the final products being delivered.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users are expected to make a best effort to rate and tag content according to the content ratings as
            described on the relevant FAQ pages. These pages are available at
            <a href="https://artconomy.com/faq/other/content-ratings">https://artconomy.com/faq/other/content-ratings</a>
            and
            <a href="https://artconomy.com/faq/other/tagging">https://artconomy.com/faq/other/tagging</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Galleries are intended for the purposes of showcasing the capabilities
            of artists offering their work, and for showcasing work that users have received from artists. Galleries
            may not be in conflict with this purpose, nor exhaust resources unreasonably.
            Examples of galleries in conflict with these principle include unreasonably large galleries, or galleries
            substantially filled by AI generated content beyond what is needed to demonstrate applicability as a
            product example or character reference.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Accounts in violation of these principles may be subject to disciplinary action,
          including account suspension and closure.
        </p>

        <h2>Arbitration</h2>
        <p>
          Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract,
          or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered
          by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules.
          The number of arbitrators shall be one. The place of arbitration shall be Houston, Texas.
          Texas law shall apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the
          arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
          thereof. The
          demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the
          claim, dispute or other
          matter in question has arisen, and in no event shall it
          be made after two years from when the aggrieved party knew or should have
          known of the controversy, claim, dispute or breach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prevailing party means the party in whose favor final judgment after appeal (if any) is rendered with
          respect to the claims asserted in the Complaint. "Reasonable attorneys' fees" are those reasonable attorneys'
          fees actually incurred in obtaining a judgment in favor of the prevailing party.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prevailing party will be entitled to Reasonable attorneys' fees.
        </p>
