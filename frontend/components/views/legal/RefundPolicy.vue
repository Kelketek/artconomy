          Artconomy endeavors to satisfy all of its customers of any issues they have with products purchased through
          our platform. However, due to the nature of services rendered, this is not always possible. This document lays
          out under what circumstances Artconomy will issue refunds for services and products rendered.
        </p>
        <h2>Refund Qualifications</h2>
        <h3>Commissioned, Digitally Delivered Art</h3>
        <p>Artconomy will issue a refund on art which its staff has determined to not meet the requirements of the
          <router-link :to="{name: 'CommissionAgreement'}">Commission Agreement</router-link>
          on the part of the artist, if the commission is covered by Artconomy Shield
        </p>
        <p>
          Artists may also elect to refund a customer before scheduled delivery and without waiting
          for dispute resolution at their discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Refunds provided by Artconomy staff as part of Artconomy Shield will be minus the full escrow fees due to
          Artconomy.
        </p>
        <h3>Commissioned, Physically Delivered Art, or Physical Items</h3>
        <p>
          Artists must use shipping methods that provide tracking information and insurance which at least covers the
          cost of the item,
          and artists are authorized to add reasonable shipping costs to the price of any deliverable to meet this
          obligation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Risk of loss passes to the commissioner when an artist delivers goods to a common carrier. However, in the
          event of
          loss, the artist must make commercially reasonable efforts to collect on the insurance for the shipment for
          the
          benefit of the commissioner. Additionally, the artist must provide reasonable documentation of such
          efforts to the commissioner. If reasonable documentation is not provided, the commissioner may be refunded,
          minus Artconomy's Escrow fees, and any explicitly marked non-refundable costs agreed to upfront by
          the commissioner and artist.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the artist fails to obtain insurance for the shipment, risk of loss passes to the commissioner upon
          shipment to the destination specified by the commissioner.
        </p>
        <h3>Artconomy Subscription Services</h3>
        <p>
          Artconomy subscription services may be refunded if a refund is requested within three business days of
          purchase or renewal.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a subscription service changes its features or pricing relevant to your activity (such as fees on
          transactions) during your current billing cycle, or within three days of a billing cycle, you may cancel your
          subscription service and receive a refund for any monthly dues for that period. Any usage fees incurred during
          that period will either be removed or adjusted to their previous values for the cycle, at the
          discretion of Artconomy. For the purposes of this clause, a billing cycle will be considered monthly, even if
          the client has agreed to a longer cycle. Cancellation of service in these cases will result in
          prorated refunds for the remaining time.
        </p>
        <h2>Refund Fees</h2>
        <p>
          As Artconomy does not control the refund policy of artists on the platform, Artconomy will always be entitled
          to its fees for its escrow service, even when the artist performs the refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          No fees are required for refunding of Artconomy Subscription services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Artconomy does not collect fees from commissioners on commissions not covered by Artconomy Shield, but fees
          may be assessed according to the terms of any payment processor the commissioner and artist agree to use.
          Artconomy does not offer any refunds for non-shield commissions.
