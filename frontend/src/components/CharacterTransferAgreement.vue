          This agreement covers the expectations for characters who are transferred, auctioned, or sold. A character
          made for transfer will be referred to as an 'adoptable' for the purposes of this agreement. Regardless of
          of compensation specified, or lack thereof, the transferer will be referred to as the seller for the purpose
          of this document, and the recipient the buyer. The transaction may be referred to as a transfer or a
          sale alternately with an understood equivalence.
        </p>

          <strong>Artconomy is not aware of any unambiguous intellectual property law concerning individual characters
          not registered as trademarks. Such laws may exist in the future or may exist in jurisdictions
          outside of Artconomy's discovery. Parties to this agreement affirm to use it to resolve disputes in
          any arbitration or court of law that will admit it in lieu of and/or in supplement of statutes or
          precedence supporting a market of adoptables.</strong>

        <h2>Affirmation of Ownership</h2>
        <p>
          The seller of the adoptable in this transfer affirms that they have created it and retained all rights or have
          otherwise obtained full rights, whatever they may entail, including right of transferrence of the adoptable.
        </p>
        <h2>Terms of Transfer</h2>
        <p>
          The seller of this adoptable agrees to relinquish any and all rights, express or implied to this adoptable,
          unless otherwise exempted by the buyer in writing. These include but are not limited to the right to claim the
          adoptable as the seller's 'own', the right to create new works including or derived from the adoptable,
          trademarks, and the right to sell or otherwise transfer rights to the adoptable in any future agreements.
        </p>
        <p>The seller affirms that the rights of any works included with this transfer (see section: Included Works)
          are currently held by them, and any qualifiers to these rights will be communicated ahead of sale. The seller
          assumes liability for any pieces or the adoptable misrepresented, willful or otherwise if the buyer comes to
          legal harm from a third party with a claim to the adoptable or included works as a result of this
          misrepresentation.
        </p>
        <h3>Included Works</h3>
        <p>

          seller is the controlling user and which the adoptable is featured in. This transfer shall be considered full
          and absolute, with no rights reserved, even if other characters are depicted in the pieces. However, no
          additional rights will be transferred concerning characters which are not involving the included adoptable,
          and all previously licensed rights to the pieces given to third parties (such as right of reproduction) before
          this transfer will be unaffected by this sale, especially those granted to Artconomy.
        </p>
        <p>Included works will only be understood to include assets held on Artconomy's </p>
        <h2>Limitation of Liability/Warranty Waiver</h2>

        <h3>Idemnity</h3>
        <p>Artconomy shall not be held liable for any misrepresentation or error on the part of the seller, and has
          performed no discovery on the rights of the adoptable and included works in this sale.</p>
