        <p>
          This agreement covers the assignment of copyright for a collection of works ("Portfolio") which contains
          a written description of a character ("Character") and zero or more artistic renderings of the Character
          between the current rights holder ("Owner"), the purchaser and assignee ("Transferee"), and the platform for transfer
          of the Portfolio (Artconomy), collectively known as "The Parties". The price and included works within the
          Portfolio are cataloged on the transfer page from which this agreement is referenced ("Exhibit A"). If the
          price is listed as $0.00 on Exhibit A, an alternative price may have been agreed to by the Owner and the
          Transferee, evidence for which will be provided by The Parties in any dispute arising from this agreement.
        </p>
        <h2>Affirmation of Ownership</h2>
        <p>
          The Owner warrants that he/she is the sole creator and/or owner of all copyrights in the
          Portfolio, and that he/she has full power to enter into this Agreement and that this Agreement does not infringe
          the rights of any third party.
        </p>
        <h2>Terms of Assignment</h2>
        <p>
          The Owner agrees that the Assignee shall from here on own the said copyrights in the Portfolio, to benefit and
          dispose of these rights in any way and at his/her sole discretion, including all rights as they pertain to
          the Character and portrayed within the Portfolio, such as the right to create derivative works using
          the Character.
        </p>
        <p>The Transferee agrees to furnish payment in the amount indicated on Exhibit A in exchange for the rights, or
          an amount previously agreed to in writing by both parties if the amount indicated on Exhibit A is $0.00.
        </p>
        <p>
          No additional rights will be transferred concerning characters which are not the Character but which may also
          be depicted in the Portfolio, and all previously licensed rights to the Portfolio's contents granted to
          Artconomy will remain, especially those granted for its service in portfolio management.
        </p>
        <p>The Parties agree that this Agreement shall be binding upon the legal successors and assigns.</p>
        <p>The Owner agrees to sign all necessary papers to procure registration of, or as further necessary to effect
          the assignment under this Agreement, as and where necessary.</p>
        <p>The parties agree to pay fees to Artconomy on the amount transferred.
          The transfer of rights will be final, with no refunds given. If any dispute arises concerning the amount
          transferred, The Parties agree that Artconomy will still be entitled to its fees collected upon the initial
          transfer.
        </p>
        <p>The price may be listed as $0.00 on Exhibit A, in which case no fees will be collected but all other terms
          of this agreement will hold.
        </p>
        <h2>Limitation of Liability/Warranty Waiver</h2>
        <p>
          The Portfolio's rights are assigned without Warranty of suitability for any purpose, express or implied.
        </p>
        <h3>Indemnity</h3>
        <p>Artconomy shall not be held liable for any misrepresentation or error on the part of the seller, and has
          performed no discovery on the rights regarding the Portfolio and the Character.
          The Transferee is responsible for any discovery and verification required.</p>
        <h2>Arbitration</h2>
        <p>
          Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract,
          or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered
          by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules.
          The number of arbitrators shall be one.  The place of arbitration shall be Houston, Texas.
          Texas law shall apply.  Judgment on the award rendered by the
          arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
          thereof. The
          demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the
          claim, dispute or other
          matter in question has arisen, and in no event shall it
          be made after two years from when the aggrieved party knew or should have
          known of the controversy, claim, dispute or breach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Artconomy's failure to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of
          those rights. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
          remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in effect.
